# Rise
First-Person horror game

Here is a link to the game on itch.io.
Rise is a free game on itch.io, Escape the building, search the rooms for ways out but above all, beware of the evils that corrupt this home. Rise was developed using Unity and assets from the Unity Asset Store. I programmed every functionality of the game including player/camera movement, game controller, animations, AI,UI, audio, and collisions using C#. This was a solo project made over two months. Feel free to visit the game page on itch.io and try it out yourself!
