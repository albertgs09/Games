This project was completed using Unity and C# when I was interning at a company called MoodMe. I developed a game for the company using their AI and emotion detection. I created a script that gets the values for each emotion and allows the player to make the emotion that is displayed. This took the entirety of the internship, which was 3 months, to complete because I had to develop and test out the demo to make sure to right emotions were being displayed.
