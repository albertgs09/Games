# Trials
First-Person Horror Game
Trials is a free game on itch.io, Figure out what has happened to the people but be careful, a torch may be your only friend now. Trials was developed using Unity and assets from the Unity Asset Store. I programmed every functionality of the game including player/camera movement, game controller, animations, audio, UI, cinematics and saving system using C#. This game was develop in a little over two months. Feel free to visit the game page on itch.io and try it out yourself!
